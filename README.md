# Quickblox Chatbot in React with Vite

This repository contains the source code for a simple chatbot built using [Quickblox](https://quickblox.com/) in a React application with Vite. The project demonstrates how to integrate Quickblox's real-time communication platform and its React UI Kit to create a functional chatbot application.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally and get it running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

   cd quickblox-chatbot
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
3. **Set up Quickblox configuration**:
   Create a new file named qbConfig.js in the src directory and add your Quickblox credentials:
   ```bash
   const QBConfig = {
   appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
   authKey: 'YOUR_AUTH_KEY',
   authSecret: 'YOUR_AUTH_SECRET',
